First of all , I am tired of Cplusplus...
I think the syntax of this languaga is so so ...(I can not find a word , I will add it when I think of a appropriate word and remeber this README , he)
So , I think it is hard to learn and grasp it , I have learn it for last 3 years and I an just a freshman to Cplusplus ...
I will continue to learn it because of I need it to find a good job in a sense
But some mechanism in it is also attractive , I love polymorphism , bind&callback ...
I will learn some design patterns with Cplusplus...

Lastly , I love C and Linux , not Cplusplus...
